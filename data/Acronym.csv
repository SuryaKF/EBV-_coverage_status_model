More expensive brand-name prescription drugs are usually considered in the “second step”. Step Therapy is developed under the guidance and direction of the P&T Committee. They review the most current research on thousands of drugs tested and approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy. The first time you submit a prescription that is not for a first-step drug, your pharmacist will receive a message to tell you that the Plan requires ST. This means if you don’t want to pay full price for your prescription drug, your doctor needs to write a new prescription for a “first-step” drug. With ST, if you’ve already tried and failed the “first-step” drug, can’t take the “first-step” drug (because of an allergy, etc.), and/or your provider can show medical necessity for the second step products, your provider can submit a request for Prior Authorization review.",
